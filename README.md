This is an application for our design project called "Design of Defective Module Detection for Solar  Panel Thermography Analysis System using Deep Learning". 

The general objective of the project is to design a defective module detection for solar panel thermography analysis that fulfills the client's requirements while adhering to engineering standards and considering various constraints such as economic, sustainability, environmental, safety, risk, public health, welfare, social, global, and cultural factors along with computation of trade-offs from selected constraints.
Specifically, it aims to:
1. Design a system prototype that detects module defects from captured thermal images namely partial shading effect, dust deposit, short-circuited PV module, and bypass diode failure.
2. Develop a mobile application that:

   2.1 Alerts users about detected defects and their priority levels.
   
   2.2 Displays detailed information about the detected defects such as stress factors, power loss, category, classes of abnormalities and description.
   
   2.3 Recommends corrective actions based on defect history.
4. Test and evaluate the accuracy of the prototype.


This application is built using FastAPI and Ultralytics YOLOv8. Using Appwrite as the backend service and React Native for the mobile application.
